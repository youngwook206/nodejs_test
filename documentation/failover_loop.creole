 * The goal of the failover threads

= Failover reconnection

//** This concern only master/slave cluster **//

On a master/slave cluster, driver will use underlying 2 connections: one to a master instance, one to a slave instance. 
When one of the connection fail, if driver does need it at once, it will create a new connection immediately before re-executing query if possible.\\
If the failed connection is not needed immediately, this driver will subscribe to the "failover reconnection" that will be handle in other threads.
Failover threads will attempt to create new connection to replace failing ones, so the interruption is minimal for the queries in progress.
When client asked to use a failed connection, the new connection created by failover thread will replace the failed one. 

Example: after a failure on a slave connection, readonly operations are temporary executed on the master connection to avoid interruption client side. 
Failover thread will then create a new slave connection that will replace the failed one. Next query will use the new slave connection.

A pool of threads is initialized when using a master/slave configuration. The pool size evolves according to the number of connection. 

== Illustration

Here is an example of a failover on a aurora cluster of 3 instances (one master and 2 slaves).\\
(Source code https://github.com/rusher/connector-aurora-fail-test/tree/master)

We can see 2 kinds of threads : 
* Threads named "test-thread-XXX" do 130 queries "SELECT 1". 1/3 use master connection, 2/3 slave connection.
* Threads "mariaDb-reconnection-XXX" are created by the driver to handle failover.

==== Colour signification:
"test-thread-XXX" threads: 
* blue: querying
* red: blocked waiting to connect

"mariaDb-reconnection-XXX" threads:  
* yellow: waiting (idle) 
* blue: working (recreating connection)
* red: blocked waiting to connect
 
When the failover occur, most of the wasted time to reconnect is supported by the reconnection thread.
Most of query will be executed normally, only a few query executions will have a small additional delay (red block on "test-thread-XXX" threads).
