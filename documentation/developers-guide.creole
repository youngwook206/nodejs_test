 * How to install a local version of connector/J
 * How to run tests locally and on travis CI
 * How to submit a request

= Contributing

Each pull request should address a single issue, and contain both the fix as well as a description of how the pull request and tests that validate that the PR fixes the issue in question.

For significant feature additions, we like to have an open issue in [[https://mariadb.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=CONJ|MariaDB JIRA]]. It is expected that discussion will have taken place in the attached issue.

= Install Prerequisites

These are the set of tools which are required in order to complete any build.  Follow the links to download and install them on your own before continuing.

* [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html|Oracle JDK 8]] ( with [[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html|JCE policies]] if using TLS/SSL)
* IDE (eclipse / netbean / intelliJ) with maven and GIT plugins

= Fork source

Before downloading source, fork the project to your own repository, and use your repository as source.  


= Run local test

Before any submission :
Run the test locally : by default, you need to have a MySQL/MariaDB server on localhost:3306 with a database named "testj" and a user root without password.
so you can run 
    
{{{
    mvn test
}}}
    
You can change those parameter by adding -DdbUrl parameter. like : 
 
{{{
    mvn test -DdbUrl=jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/testj?user=root&password=*****
}}}
    
You can launch a specific test by adding -Dtest

{{{
    mvn test -Dtest=org.mariadb.jdbc.JdbcParserTest
}}}
    
When all test are passing, you can package project.
Additional tests , like javadoc formatting, code style validation will be done : 
  
{{{
    mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
}}}
    
If operation succeed, a new mariadb-java-client jar will be on the target folder.
  
= Run travis test
    
You can activate travis to validate your repository. 
The advantage of travis compare to running test locally is that it will launch tests for a combination of those parameters : 

jdk:
* oraclejdk8
* oraclejdk7

server :
* MariaDB 5.5
* MariaDB 10.0
* MariaDB 10.1
* MariaDB 10.2
* MySQL 5.6
* MySQL 5.7

max_allowed_packet : 
* 1M
* 16M
* 32M

For that, you have to go on [[https://travis-ci.org|travis website]], connect with your github account, and activate your mariadb-connector-j repository.
After this step, every push to your repository will launch a travis test. 

== Submitting a request

When your repository has the correction/change done, you can submit a pull request by clicking the "Pull request" button on github. 
Please detail the operation done in your request.
